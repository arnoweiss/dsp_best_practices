# Dataspace Protocol Best Practices

## Abstract

This document presents best practices for the usage of the [Dataspace Protocol](https://eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base.github.io/DataspaceProtocol/).
Dataspaces that use the Dataspace Protocol are advised to specify certain conventions that the protocol leaves open for
the sake of agnosticity and extensibility. This document points out some of them.

## Status of this document

The Best Practices are created and published by the [Eclipse Dataspace Working Group](https://dataspace.eclipse.org/).
They currently don't match releases but refer to the latest published version.

## Introduction

The Dataspace Protocol has reached stability and adoption in multiple Dataspaces. These and future Dataspaces cover 
varying use cases. As such, each poses requirements that the protocol must accommodate.
